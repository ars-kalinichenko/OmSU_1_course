# OmSU_2020
🏋🏽 Various laboratory and homework, as well as sketches, created during the course at IMIT OmSU.
* Bakhta/individual_homework - Large individual works, which were given for 2 weeks - a month.

* Bakhta/labs - Small assignments that prepare for individual assignments

😕 In some places the code looks too documented as this is one of the requirements. There are also many more elegant patterns that could be used to do these assignments, but again this is due to the requirements of the teacher.
